black list certain names, and also add character limit

maybe let the people name the "fishes", then create tinder profiles with the name of the fishes

somehow my turn was skipped, I did not play any cards
possibly fixed?

incrementing white cards is STILL bugged?
check if played is empty

add emotes

forgot about people rejoining

message is wrong at the top

make cards scroll, and custom box gets bigger, and possibly character limit

change the choosing method 

maybe change it to "blank is checking out blank's fish"

add removing ability
