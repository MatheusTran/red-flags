black list certain names, and also add character limit

maybe let the people name the "fishes", then create tinder profiles with the name of the fishes

incrementing white cards is STILL bugged?
check if played is empty

add emotes

make cards scroll, and custom box gets bigger, and possibly character limit

change the choosing method, perhaps use react to make a tinder swiper

maybe change it to "blank is checking out blank's fish"

add removing ability

use character index instead of order attribute, this could make things simpler, however the scoreboard will now shuffle every time
swiper boolean is now obsolete
these two are now complete?

and simplify socket.on(increment)

also change the username checker to id, to avoid problems with the same username

create tabs for cards

implement room search, and browse lobbies, implement a binary search algorithm 

add react

Redis database

Add APIs like dice bear

doubly linked lists for the order of each player
