make cards transparent before presenting

black list certain names, and also add character limit

maybe let the people name the "fishes", then create tinder profiles with the name of the fishes

somehow my turn was skipped, I did not play any cards
possibly fixed?

incrementing white cards is bugged?

add emotes
